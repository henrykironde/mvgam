Description: Fitting Bayesian Generalised Additive Models to sets of discrete
    time series. The primary purpose of the package is to build a version
    of dynamic factor models that incorporates the flexibility of GAMs in
    the linear predictor and latent dynamic trend components that are
    useful for time series analysis and forecasting. Estimation is
    performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with either the Gibbs
    sampling software JAGS or with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in the software
    Stan. The package also includes utilities for online updating of
    forecast distributions with a recursive particle filter that uses
    sequential importance sampling to assimilate new observations as they
    become available. References: Clark & Wells (2022)
